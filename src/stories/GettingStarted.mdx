# Easy to use

This documentation will help with the [azion-webkit](https://github.com/aziontech/azion-webkit) project,
using [PrimeVue V3](https://v3.primevue.org/) as the basic component library and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for CSS styling.

**Projects:**

- [azion-webkit](https://github.com/aziontech/azion-webkit)
- [azion-theme](https://github.com/aziontech/azion-theme)

## Stack

- Node.js v20.x.x
- Vue;
  - PrimeVue;
- Tailwind;
  - Prime Vue Sass Theme Base;
  - Primeflex;

## Development

In the project where components/blocks/templates are used, their dependencies must be included;

```json
// Your project's package.json
...

"dependencies": {
    "vue": "^3.3.11",
    "azion-webkit": "^1.49.4",
    "azion-theme": "^1.4.0",
    "@tailwindcss/typography": "^0.5.10",
    "@vee-validate/yup": "^4.12.6",
    "tailwind": "^4.0.0",
    "yup": "^1.3.2",
    "vee-validate": "^4.11.8",
  },

...
```

Now, installing the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This will pull the dependencies from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

> [Azion Docs](https://github.com/aziontech/docs/) uses Azion's Front-End packages and can be used as an example.

### Making Modifications Locally

For local development before publishing to npm, we use [npm link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/commands/npm-link).
You will need to have a folder structure similar to:

```
| - azion-webkit
| ---- npm install && npm link;
| - docs
| ---- npm install && npm link azion-webkit;
```

With these steps, you can make modifications and test locally before submitting the package to npm.
